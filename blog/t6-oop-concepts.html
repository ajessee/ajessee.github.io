    <p>Welcome to another edition of me trying to explain something to you that I don't really understand. I know that I probably shouldn't issue that disclaimer every time I write a new blog entry, but I just want to provide full disclosure. As far as I can tell there is a very limited audience for this blog - current and potential DBC students, the members of my family and friends who I've suckered into reading it, and potential employers. I write this as I am about to enter the on-site portion of DBC, and I'm sure I'll learn a lot more while I'm there. I'll probably revisit this blog when I'm done and laugh at how little I actually knew and updated it with all my newly acquired Jedi wisdom.
    </p>

    <p>So today I'm going to try to talk about Ruby classes and methods and compare and contrast the two. Quick refresher for those of you who have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about (I'm looking at you friends and family...), Ruby is a computer programming language. You can build program and applications with it, and it is also used to build programs for the web.</p>

    <p>Now for the hard stuff. Ruby modules are like dictionaries. You have a "key", which is like a word, and a "value" which is like that word's definition. This relationship between the key and the value maps one thing to another. This information resides in a Ruby file, which can then be imported into the computer program that you are writing. In this sense, a module is like a library with dictionaries in it. If you want to access the dictionaries, you can import the library into your computer program. Then, everything that is in the dictionaries is accessible in your program. However, a module just doesn't contain information in the form of variables that have data in them. They also contain functions, or a thing that takes an input and produces an output. (Think of a mathematical equation.) When you import these files, or modules into your computer program, you can reference and use everything in that module.
    </p>

    <p>Ruby classes are also like modules, in that they contain variables and functions too. However, classes are more like factories. They are the place that you create "objects", which is a fancy term for a container. This container also has variables and functions inside of it, but the walls of the container prevent the rest of the computer program from seeing what is inside of it. This stuff is the foundation of object-oriented programming, but we're not going to get into that today. All you have to think about is that classes are factories in which you build molds for these objects. You can create thousands of objects that have similar characteristics that are dictated by the class. When you create a new object, it is called "instantiating" an object.    
    </p>

    <p>OK well that was a lot to digest, so we'll just leave it there for now. I'll be back with more information and try to present it in a clearer way once I get a better handle on it.</p>
