# U2.W4: Technical Blog Entry

## Learning Competencies
- Research a public Ruby method and identify a scenario it could be used in
- Explain how to use an existing Ruby method

## Summary
In this blog, you will do a bit of research on an Enumerable method and teach the method to your reader. Time-box yourself to an hour -- max 1.5 hours on your blog post. These aren't expected to be professional or perfect, but meant to show where you are at this point in your learning.

## Release 0: New file
Copy your blog template in to a new HTML file in the blog-posts directory named `t4-enumerable-methods.html`.

Make sure to add your links on the blog/index.html so people can easily navigate to your awesome blog posts!

## Release 1: Research an Enumerable Method

Select one of the Ruby Enumerable methods or data structures below. After doing some research, think of an example to teach others what you learned about this method.

#### Topics
- `Enumerable#map`
- `Enumerable#group_by`
- `Enumerable#cycle`

## Release 2: Blog
Write a blog post that teaches others what you learned about the way this enumerable method works and how to use it. Be sure to include code samples in your blog to show others what you are talking about.

Write this blog for an audience of newb programmers.

## Release 3: Publish
Link to your blog on the blog/index.html page of your site and push your changes. Make sure all of your posts so far are linked on the index in order.

## Release 4: Promote
Now it's time to show off your work and share your knowledge with your cohort-mates using Twitter!

Tweet your blog post using the hashtag **#DBCRuby** so your cohort-mates can find it.

## Release 5: Read
Use Twitter to find other people's blog posts.

Read at least two other posts, or read one for each topic. Give the author A.S.K (Actionable, Specific, and Kind) feedback as an [issue](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md) on their repo or a tweet!
