    <p>In my last job I worked as a project manager for an international development company in Washington, DC. The position encapsulated a number of different roles and responsibilities; one of which was to manage the time and deliverables of our consultants on the projects. Most of the projects I managed were for the U.S. Department of State and were focused on climate change issues. 
    </p>

    <p>I had to manage conflict on one particular project where our lead consultant, who was tasked with writing the final evaluation report, was not performing at an acceptable level. He was missing deadlines and when he did submit his writing, it was far below expectations. Our team was made up of my boss, the technical director for the project, this lead consultant, another mid-level consultant who was also writing parts of the report, and myself. The lead consultant and my boss had a personal relationship, and my boss was working on a number of different projects and was overwhelmed with her other responsibilities. When I brought up the issue of his performance, she was not responsive. However, I knew that the client would be unhappy with the results.
    </p>

    <p>This made me feel angry, disappointed, and frustrated. The lead consultant was submitting his time sheets to me, and I didn't feel like the time he was logging matched up with the quantity or quality of his work. I knew that this was an ethical question, but I wasn't in the position to directly question him; that was my boss's role. My boss was too busy to quality control appropriately, and I felt like their personal relationship played a role in that as well. She indicated to me that she had worked with him before and was confident of his abilities. I wanted to bring this up to the head of our department, but I also didn't want to undermine my boss. At the end of the day, I worked with the mid-level consultant to help re-write most of the report, and the client really liked the result.</p>

    <p>In retrospect, I wish I had been a little more forceful in addressing this issue with the lead consultant and my boss. I could have escalated it to the head of our department but I felt like that would have jeopardized my standing in the company. It's a delicate balancing act trying to hold people accountable but also having to deal with the inter-office politics of that. I think at the end of the day, if I was honest, actionable, and kind with my feedback and was still not getting the results, I should have brought it to the attention of other people in the same way.</p>
