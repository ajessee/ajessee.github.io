      What is Git? What are the benefits of version control? 
    </p>

    <p>
      From my understanding, Git is a piece of software that lives on your computer. You access this software through the command line, which makes you feel like a super cool nerd right off the bat.
    </p>

    <p>
       Git is basically just version control software. It sets up different working directories (these are like folders for people who use Windows or Mac) and allows you to branch off from your work if you want to have different versions. The first branch is actually called a root. I know this is confusing, but just go with the tree analogy for now. You've got the root, and then branches off of this main root. This main root is called the "Master" branch, where the best possible work product, in this case code, lives. Then there are other branches where you can store other versions of this code. For the sake of simplicity, let's just imagine there is one other branch, which we'll call "Working". You copy your perfect code from the "Master" branch to the "Working" branch, and then manipulate all your code in the "Working" branch, leaving the "Master" branch untouched in case you get into a FUBAR situation.
    </p>

    <p>
       I'll try to use another analogy, one that most modern day office workers would understand. (This is how I had to think about this stuff to make it click). Imagine that your code is a Microsoft Word document. You would start with opening a blank file, saving it with a title, and writing a first draft. Since you write so fancy, it looks pretty good and you are convinced that it could be published/submitted/emailed/whatever right away. However, you have to deal with the oppressive managerial hierarchy so they want to be able to make comments and stuff. You copy your masterpiece to the "Working" branch, and then make any stupid changes that your incompetent bosses want.
    </p>   

    <p>
        The really cool thing about Git is that is allows for interaction, so you can push and/or pull files from other people. So once you make a copy of your Word document into the "Working" branch, you can send that off to your overlords for them to review and dare them to find any imperfections. Once they get a hold of it and wax and wane poetic over your already perfect copy, you can merge it back into your "Working" version and see what changes you need to begrudgingly make. Once you "approve" of these changes, you can merge them back into your "Master" branch to finalize the process. This reason this analogy works is that these functionalities have already been built into the latest versions of Microsoft Word.
    </p>

    <p>
        The innovation that is GitHub is that it is a central location that can host these files (or "repositories"). That way, if the person I am working with is in a different time zone, I donâ€™t have to wait for them to push to me or me to pull from them in real time, we can just push to GitHub, and then pull from GitHub when we need to. It improves efficiency and collaboration, and makes for a more productive process.
