      What is Git? What are the benefits of version control? 

      From my understanding, Git is a piece of software that lives on your computer and you access it through the command line. It is basically just version control software that sets up different working directories and allows you to branch off from your work if you want to have different versions. I imagine it to be iterative, that is, if your code were a Microsoft Word document, you would start with opening a blank file, saving it with a title, and that would be the first version. Then you start writing stuff, save it, and that becomes your second version. So on and so forth. But then, if you are really sure you like your third version, you can commit it to the master branch, and that becomes the latest and greatest (and working) version. Git allows for interaction, so you can push and pull files from other people. If I am working on code, I can push my latest version to someone else and they can look at it and make changes and then I can pull it back from them or they can push it to me. It’s a good way to collaborate.

      The innovation that is GitHub is that it is a central location that can host these repositories. That way, if the person I am working with is in a different time zone, I don’t have to wait for them to push to me or me to pull from them in real time, we can just push to GitHub, and then pull from GitHub when we need to.
