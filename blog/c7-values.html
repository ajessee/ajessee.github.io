    <p>This is an exercise in exploring my values and affirming them.</p>

    <p>When I have been the most happy in my life I think of the following values. In general, I try to live up to these values. The rating below the following values will indicate how much I agree that I try to live up to the particular value. </p>
    <p><i>
    Activism</i>
    </p>
    <p>
    Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- <b>4</b> ----- 5 Agree
    </p>

    <p><i>
    Compassion</i>
    </p>
    <p>
    Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- <b>5</b> Agree
    </p>

    <p><i>
    Efficiency</i>
    </p>
    <p>
    Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- <b>4</b> ----- 5 Agree
    </p>

    <p><i>
    Growth</i>
    </p>
    <p>
    Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- <b>4</b> ----- 5 Agree
    </p>

    <p><i>
    Honesty</i>
    </p>
    <p>
    Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- <b>5</b> Agree
    </p>

    <p><i>
    Self-knowledge</i>
    </p>
    <p>
    Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- <b>5</b> Agree
    </p>

    <p>Out of all these values, I would like to expand for a moment on compassion. I feel like compassion is one of my most important values because it gives me grace. When I see the world through a lens of compassion, everything seems a little gentler, a little kinder. I give people the benefit of the doubt, and I also try to imagine that they are struggling with things as much as I am. This perspective leads me to a place of gratitude, because if I can have compassion for others, I can have compassion for myself and also be grateful for all the blessings in my own life.</p>

    <p>The last topic that someone asked for my advice on was about a personal relationship that person was struggling with. In the end, it came down to honesty, and my advice was for that person to be candid with the other. I believe that in the end, if you are honest with others, even if you don't get the results that you want, you can be at peace with yourself knowing that you have nothing to hide and nothing to regret.</p>

    <p>When I think about these values it makes me feel strong. Values are like assets. In fact, assets create value, so I see these things as ways to make my life richer and more fulfilling. In terms of how these relate to stereotype threat, I don't really feel that threat, but I do think that whenever I'm not feeling part of or I'm feeling less than, I can rely on these values and how they have shaped my character to affirm to myself that I'm going to be just fine.</p>
