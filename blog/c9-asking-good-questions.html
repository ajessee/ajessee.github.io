    <p>I know that asking good questions is going to be a key to my success at DBC. I feel like I am pretty good at asking questions already, but I also know that I can always be learning and improving.
    </p>

    <p>I liked the stackoverflow guide to asking questions. The idea of presenting each question as clearly and succinctly as possible as if you are asking a very busy person a question makes sense to me. I think the first step in asking a good question is doing the research and looking for answers as much as possible first. Once you have exhausted every possible means to find an answer, then you can start asking questions.
    </p>

    <p>After you have tried to figure it out on your own, then you have to find out who is the best person to ask this question to. Who has the most expertise on it; who is the most likely person to know the answer. Once you've identified this person, then you have to formulate the question. I think being as detailed but as brief as possible is important. You don't want to waste a person's time.</p>

    <p>Finally, you have to be prepared for the answer. If the answer comes in the form of an email, then it is automatically documented. If it is a verbal answer, you have to be prepared to take notes. If you have any questions about the answer or need further clarification, I think it makes sense to turn that request around immediately so that you don't stretch the process out for too long.</p>
