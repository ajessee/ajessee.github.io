    Well, this week was hard. Again. It was exciting though because it was our introduction to the Ruby programming language. Apparently, Ruby is intuitive and elegant and easy to learn. At first glance, some of the concepts are easy to understand, but it gets pretty hairy quickly </p>

    <p>
    I'm going to try to explain the concepts of Arrays and Hashes in Ruby. I have to keep in mind that I am writing for a non-technical audience, but the truth is that if you are actually reading this it's because you have some interest in coding.</p>

    <p>
    Let's start with the concept of a variable. We all(?) remember it from math - it's an empty symbol that you can assign a value to. Well, it turns out that variables are important in coding. It lets you store and manipulate data. In Ruby, assigning a value to a variable is simple, and it looks like high school math: x = 10. Then, you can put in x in your code and once is value of 10 is assigned, it will execute the code as if x was 10.</p>

    <p>
    Arrays and hashes are like variables; they contain a value. Except that arrays and hashes can contain multiple values. Instead of x just equaling ten, you can assign various integers, objects, or strings to them. It looks like this: x = [1, 2, 3, 'one, 'two', 'three'] This means that x now holds all these values, though they are delineated with an indexing system.</p>

    <p>
    This is where you start to see the differentiation between arrays and hashes. In arrays, our example of x = [1, 2, 3, 'one, 'two', 'three'] contains 6 items. You can have the code refer to these items by calling on their order, which is the index. You count from left to right, however, you don't start at 1, you start at 0. In this case, the integer 1 is at the 0 index, integer 2 is at the 1 index, integer 3 is at the 2 index, and string 'one' is at the 3 index, etc.  </p>

    <p> In hashes, there is no built in index. You build it. This is called a key/value pair. You assign a value a "key", so that when you call on that key, the code spits out it's value. I'm still learning exactly how to do this, but that's what I know so far. </p>


    <p>Come back next week for another installment of my foolhardy attempt at explaining stuff.</p>
