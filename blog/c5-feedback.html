    In my experience so far in phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp, I have noticed that there is a real emphasis on learning how to play nice with others. We've been introduced to the concepts of emotional intelligence, and by extension, engineering empathy. I've already touched on emotional intelligence in a previous blog entry, but to re-visit it, it's a combination of self-regulation, empathy, and social skills. Engineering empathy is based on the belief that most software projects fail because of a human error - not a lack of technical knowledge. This whole approach is not only focusing on the mind, but on approaching emotions and the body.

    These concepts are useful because in development you have to work on teams with other people. Anytime you have to interact with others, there is a potential for conflict and miscommunication. By focusing on working with other people and monitoring what is happening inside yourself, you can potentially head off issues that arise when working with others.

    DBC is big on peer pairing. This is where you are working with another person to solve complex problems and write code. The concept behind it is that you have one person "driving" (this person is at the keyboard and typing everything in) and one person "navigating" (looking up information online, thinking through the code, directing the execution of the writing). This way, there are two sets of eyes and brains working on the same problem. DBC uses peer-pairing because it is begin used in the marketplace more and more. Companies are realizing that they get better product in less time when they use peer-pairing.

    At this point in my phase 0 experience, I have paired a number of times with people while working on challenges. I have found it to be both rewarding and frustrating. I really like having two sets of eyes and two brains looking at the same problem. This way, if the driver makes a mistake, the navigator has a chance to catch it and correct it before it creates a bug in the program. At this stage, it is also really helpful because we have limited knowledge of what we are doing, and often times one person has learned about or being exposed to a strategy or method that the other hasn't. It is an opportunity to learn from each other and flatten the learning curve a bit. The challenges I have faced are usually with personalities. I try to manage expectations for both myself and my pair in the beginning by having a conversation about what each of us wants to do. Usually, when we have clearly defined who is going to drive and who is going to navigate there are fewer issues that arise. I have had a few frustrating experiences where I feel like my pair and I are jumping around and wrestling for control of the keyboard.

    Another big point of focus at DBC is on feedback. It is a chance to give information back to your pair about how you perceived the pairing session went, as well as receive that same feedback. DBC has an anonymous feedback mechanism where you can feel free to be candid about someone. I feel like I have received generally fair and kind feedback from my pairs. Part of the problem I see is that I haven't really been trained on providing feedback until now. I like the concept of feedback being actionable, specific, and kind. This way, you don't feel like you are being attacked, but I have specific and actionable information to improve your approach next time. However, this takes practice and much of the feedback I have received was general and positive but lacked actionable specifics. I myself have struggled with how to phrase certain issues that I found in a way that is honest but still kind. The beauty is that we have ample opportunities to get better as we go through this program.
