      I'm super behind, so I'm going to have to publish my thoughts on time management (unironically) and then come back once I get a chance to watch Shereef's video, digest, and process.

        I don’t really manage my time currently. I have been doing consultant work with my old job and I have been doing what I want, when I want. It has been liberating not having to go into work at the same time everyday and be on someone else’s time schedule. Unfortunately, I have not put myself on my own time schedule, but I would like to start doing that now. My plan is simple - wake up early (like ridiculously early 5:30 AM), stretch, meditate, walk the dog, and eat a light breakfast. After that, I’m going to go to the gym and then come back and have a bigger breakfast. Then I’ll get ready for work, which I would like to start at 9 AM. I’ll have to push this back to 8 AM once I start the intensive phase of DBC. I plan on using the pomadoro or timebox technique to work uninterrupted for 25 minutes and then take a 5 minute break. I’d like to do this for about 3-4 hours in the morning before taking a longer break to change locations or go for a walk and have lunch. Then I’ll get back to it and do another 3-4 hour session with regular breaks and try to put in 50 hours a week. I have a lot to learn and I need to really put in the effort now to ensure that I can succeed in the nine week intensive portion. I can’t really afford to repeat sections, so I need to be dedicated now to get my foundation down right. I am also interested in mindfulness and flow. I will start meditating everyday to start exercising that mental muscle. If I can do it early in the morning when I am awake I think that would be a good way to start the day. I will also look for opportunities to meditate during the day and then also at night. The other techniques that I will try to incorporate into my daily habits are the idea of chunking or breaking things down into smaller tasks as well as making sure that I am tracking my time and progress so that I can see changes and build momentum.
