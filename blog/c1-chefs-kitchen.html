  <h1>Consumer Mode Versus Creator Mode in Education</h1>
  <h4>Thursday, May 28th. Still late.</h4>

    It was good to finally meet Shereef “The Bearded Wonder” Bishay during our fireside chat. Here is a man who started Dev Bootcamp after winning a bet with a friend, and instead of insisting that his friend pay up, he started a web development bootcamp to teach him and others how to code. Shereef has a natural aura of kindness and awareness about him, and you can tell that his is passionate when he speaks because he can speak at length and be both informative and compassionate with his audience. </p>

	The kitchen versus table analogy worked for me, as I worked for many years as a server in a restaurant. I’ve seen both the front of the house and the back of the house, and have had my fair share of unpleasant experiences with rude customers. While I could relate, the consumer versus creator mode comparison resonated even more with me. As Shereef points out, in the Western world we are trained to be consumers. As our consumer culture has shifted into overdrive and we experience a heretofore unimaginable level of material wealth, many of us feel spiritually poorer and ironically less empowered. Our agency to live full and rewarding lives has been taken away from us as we have shifted from producers and manufacturers to strictly consumers. Whereas we used to be more civically engaged and took ownership of our politics, communities, and neighborhoods, our paradigms are shifting to allow someone else to “take care” of the problems. We have been told that we deserve to have everything that we want when we want (without much effort), and thus our understanding of what it takes to get things done has eroded and our ability to do it has atrophied. </p>

	We are told to think of everything as a product or service, and that it is owed to us. It’s hard not to feel entitled. I can get Amazon to ship me a shiny new toy, but if I don’t see the design process, the manufacturing process, the supply chain, the workers, the distribution, and all the hard work that goes into it, I’ll just think that somehow a magic drone delivers these goods that are just 3D printed out of thin air. This entitlement spoils us in many ways. I’ll play with my toy until I get bored a few weeks later and discard it in that wonderful fantasy world of “somewhere else.” I believe that is we look at everything like that, we miss out on the full richness of the experience of life. </p>

	The fireside chat was a good reminder to me that our educational system is broken and there is a better way to learn. Everything I have researched has shown me that DBC cares deeply about teaching skills that can empower people like me to reach their goals. They focus very much on learning how to learn, different learning styles, being kind but holding people accountable for their actions, and teaching people how to think holistically about the web development process. I am excited about being part of this, and the first week of the prep process has been a shock to my system. It’s like drinking out of a firehose. It has tested my abilities, my discipline, my hunger and made me question if I am in the right place. I am experiencing the imposter syndrome first-hand, and I haven’t even gotten on-site yet. Yet, I know that I am interested in the material and it is actually fun for me. My plan is to build my stick-to-it-ive-ness muscles, and take ownership of my experience at DBC. </p>
