    At the risk of sounding like an advertisement for Dev Bootcamp, I will say that I think the thing that differentiates them from their competitors is a holistic view of education. There is a real emphasis on learning how to learn, and I have really enjoyed it so far. I have a four-year college degree so I know "how to school", but I didn't incorporate learning skills like reflection, emotional intelligence, and feedback into that experience. I've been very aware of myself as I've gone through the first 3 weeks of this process, and it has yielded some interesting insights.</p>

    <p>
    Part of this process was learning about the Gregorc Thinking Style and taking a quiz to determine my own thinking style. Turns out, I'm multi-modal, which just means I don't fit neatly into one of four boxes. Your thinking style can be concrete sequential, concrete random, abstract sequential, or abstract random. Or some combination, like myself. The one thinking style I fit into a lot is abstract sequential. There is a handy chart that indicates what you like, how you learn best, and what is hard for you.</p>

    <p>
    What I've learned about myself is that I like looking at issues logically and working through them. I like to work alone, and I need to have access to a lot of resources. I have to take my time working through things, usually by trial and error, and I need to constantly reference information to be able to put it all together. Paring can be a challenge for me because it feels like when our team hits a roadblock, I want to try a bunch of different things but also not expose my ignorance.</p>

    <p>
    I also realize that I need to manage my time way more effectively and minimize distractions. I can really absorb the concepts when I have the time and space to really read everything, and work and tinker through all the challenges. If I don't get into "flow", I can have a real hard time getting things done.</p>


    <p> My plan going forward is to really time-box out my task and stick with those parameters that I've set. I can already tell that my brain is being challenged and that I'm adding new layers of knowledge and understanding around these concepts. I'll keep you guys updated about how that goes.</p>
