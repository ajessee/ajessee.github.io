    <p>This week we dove into JavaScript. It was a little bit of a shock to the system, because we had been immersed in Ruby for the last four weeks. It definitely felt like we were shifting gears, though I can't tell if it was an up-shift or down-shift. At first blush, it seems like JavaScript is much less elegant than Ruby. There are fewer built-in methods, and fewer options for looping. The conditional statements are similar, so that feels familiar. If you are reading this and are a potential DBC student, or someone that hasn't tried coding, those last couple sentences probably didn't make sense. So let me try to break it down for you, but rest assured, I wouldn't have had any idea what I was talking about a few weeks ago so don't be intimidated.
    </p>

    <p>Let's start with methods. Methods are functions in Ruby. Functions are things that take an input and spit out an output. Think back to your math classes and the quadratic equation. Just kidding, that's way too wonky of an example. Let's simplify even further. Think of a meat grinder. Meat goes in, ground meat comes out. That's kind like a function. You can create a simple function for something like addition. You input 2 or more integers, and after the function runs, it will output the sum of those integers. The idea of built-in methods is that some of these functions have already been written for you, and they exist in a "library" that you can run. So when you want to see how many character are in a "string" (basically a sentence), you can "call" (run) the .length method in Ruby and it will count the numbers of characters in the string. This same .length built-in method exists in JavaScript. However, there are a number of other built-in methods that Ruby has that are simply missing in JavaScript. What this means is that you will have to build the functions (methods) from scratch. Oh, and that's another difference. A function is called a method in Ruby, but just called a function in JavaScript. Although a function inside of an object is called a method in JavaScript. (Confused yet?) 
    </p>

    <p>Next we'll move on to looping. Looping is basically going over a section of code over and over again, until a certain condition is met, or until it hits a point where you have indicated that it is time break out of the loop. If neither of these things happen, you get stuck in an infinite loop, and yes, it's like being in Alice and Wonderland. In JavaScript you can use "while" loops, which say that while a certain condition is present, the loop will run. For example, while a variable "x" is less than (<) 10, the loop will continue to run. You can do something in the loop to add to "x" so that eventually, "x" becomes greater than 10 and the loop ends. The "do" loop is basically the same as the "while" loop, but it differs in one way. It executes the body of the loop once before it tests the conditional. Finally, the most sophisticated loop in JavaScript (as far as I know), is the "for" loop. It is similar to the "while" loop but builds in a counter to the loop. You provide it will a counter and set the value, then you provide it with the condition that it has to meet to break out of the loop, and then you add to the counter in any denomination you want. In Ruby, you have all these loops and host of other methods to loop and iterate over data. I'd go over them, but I know I've lost you already.</p>

    <p>Finally, there are conditional statements. These are logic statements that are at the core of programming. They are part of what is called the "control flow" of the program, which is a fancy way to say that it controls where the program goes. The if/else conditional statement is a pretty classic example. If you like cheese, then the program will execute some part of the code (maybe to further determine what kind of cheese you like and get you to buy some), and if you don't like cheese ("else"), then it will execute some other part of the code. These conditional statements are almost identical in Ruby and JavaScript. There are if/else statements, as well as if/else if/else statements that allow you to give more than 2 options. The one difference I've found is the in Ruby the "else if" statement is contracted to "elsif" whereas in JavaScript is stays as to words, "else if".</p>

    <p>This was a little taste of some of the differences in Ruby and Javascript, and I'll try to get around to updating this as I learn more. Happy learning to you too!</p>
