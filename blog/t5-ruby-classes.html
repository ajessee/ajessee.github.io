    Ruby classes. What can I say? Well, I could make it really confusing and tell you that classes are objects, but that classes spawn objects. Huh?
    </p>

    <p>Here is how I look at it. If you want to create multiple objects in Ruby, classes are how you do it. They serve as a kind of blueprint for the objects you are creating. You can give objects standard characteristics that they will inhert from the classes.</p>
