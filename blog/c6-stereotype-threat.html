    <p>I am a mixed-race, Hispanic male. My father is white and from the Midwest, and my mother is Hispanic and from El Salvador. I was born here in the United States, but I grew up in a number of different countries as a result of my dad's job in the foreign service. I've had such a confusing and convoluted personal experience that I've never really identified as a member of a race. My skin is brown but I look racially ambiguous, so I am not usually immediately classified as a member of a race or group by others. I speak Spanish fluently, but other than that, I don't have much of a cultural connection with El Salvador. I have never gone to visit, and my mother is not close with her family. Her mother and siblings live in the United States, and she has no contact with anyone outside of her immediate family. Although I lived in Latin America for 7 years as a child, we were more immersed in the ex-pat community than the larger communities. I went to American schools in both Bolivia and Nicaragua, and while I did have plenty of friends from those countries, we lived inside a cultural American bubble.
    </p>

    <p>As a result, I have never really experienced any racial profiling or been subjected to stereotypes (to my knowledge). I have always had to adapt to new situations and new environments, so I did my best to integrate myself as quickly as possible. Part of my experience was living in places where the communities were not homogeneous. There was not a plurality in the populations, so everyone looked a little different. In retrospect, I feel like this was a huge advantage for me growing up; I couldn't imagine being a minority in a larger population.    
    </p>

    <p>However, this a reality for many people. It happens in many other countries, but it does seem like Americans have a fascination with putting people in groups based on there physical appearance or social-economic class. There are well-worn stereotypes that follow people around, and in reading about the stereotype threat, it seems like they are much more insidious I realized. The basic idea of the stereotype threat is that when people encounter a stereotype that is ascribed to their group, they internalize it and end up conforming to it. One example I read about is that when race was emphasized to black college students before a standardized test, they performed worse than their white classmates. However when race was not emphasized, they performed better and equivalently to their white classmates.

    <p>The challenge with this in tech is that there is an underrepresentation of minorities in tech jobs. If minorities do not feel like they are capable of learning the skills that it takes to work in this field because they have internalized some false narrative of their abilities, they will be less likely to undertake the effort to try to learn. It is self-reinforcing and self-defeating. In reading about this issue, it seems like one of the best interventions is to actively teach students that not only are societies pre-conceptions bogus and often rooted in ignorance and racism, but that intelligence is malleable and most individuals are capable of learning whatever they put their mind to.
