    It's hard not to get excited about technology. It is, after all, the main thing that has differentiated us from other animals. Our ancestors evolved opposable thumbs, and soon after we began making and using tools. These tools were first used for hunting, warfare, and collecting and preparing food. As we evolved further, we developed more and more sophisticated technologies. Once we developed agriculture and freed ourselves from the natural limits of nature, our productivity and ingenuity really took off.

    Now we are at a point where we have computers that are in our pockets more powerful than all of those used to send humanity to the moon. Smart phones and the Internet have revolutionized the way that we live, work, do business, and communicate. I'm studying to learn how to code so that I can manipulate computers and leverage their power to build applications for a variety of functions, some that I may have the chance to invent.

    <p>There are so many clear opportunities and benefits that technology has brought, but there are also negative consequences of the proliferation of technology through every aspect of our lives. I'm talking specifically about the environmental consequences of the technologies we use and have come to depend on. First, there is the air, water, heat, and noise pollution that is caused by our collective production and use of technology. As more and more people are able to afford laptops, desktops, tablet, mobile phones, music players, cameras, etc, there is a larger ecological footprint created in the manufacture and use of these gadgets. All the way through the supply chain, from the extraction of resources and manufacture of the hardware, to the processing of the e-waste that is produced, to the energy that it takes to manufacture and run these devices, there are vast inefficiencies. As the Internet has grown and the shift has begun to cloud computing, there are more server farms needing more and more energy to run. Many of these farms are run using electricity generated by burning coal.</p>

    <p>If we are going to solve many of our environmental issues, we are going to need technology and the power we can leverage from it. However, we have to shift to a less resource intensive model for production and use. There are shifts towards modular device manufacture, where you can swap out old batteries or obsolete parts without having to replace the whole device. I think once we get producers involved and have them take responsibility for the waste that their products make, you can incentivize them to get rid of many of today's inefficiencies.</p>
