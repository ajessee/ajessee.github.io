    At the risk of sounding like an advertisment for Dev Bootcamp, I will say that I think the thing that differentiates them from their competitors is a holistic view of education. There is a real emphasis on learning how to learn, and I have really enjoyed it so far. I have a four-year college degree so I know "how to school", but I didn't incorporate learning skills like reflection, emotional intelligence, and feedback into that experience. I've been very aware of myself as I've gone through the first 3 weeks of this process, and it has yielded some interesting insights.</p>
