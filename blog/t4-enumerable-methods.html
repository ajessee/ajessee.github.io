    At the risk of sounding like an advertisment for Dev Bootcamp, I will say that I think the thing that differentiates them from their competitors is a holistic view of education. There is a real emphasis on learning how to learn, and I have really enjoyed it so far. I have a four-year college degree so I know "how to school", but I didn't incorporate learning skills like reflection, emotional intelligence, and feedback into that experience. I've been very aware of myself as I've gone through the first 3 weeks of this process, and it has yielded some interesting insights.</p>

    ## Learning Competencies
    - Research a public Ruby method and identify a scenario it could be used in
    - Explain how to use an existing Ruby method

    ## Summary
    In this blog, you will do a bit of research on an Enumerable method and teach the method to your reader. Time-box yourself to an hour -- max 1.5 hours on your blog post. These aren't expected to be professional or perfect, but meant to show where you are at this point in your learning.
