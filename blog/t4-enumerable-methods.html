    <p>e·nu·mer·a·ble     / əˈn(y)o͞omərəb(ə)l/</p>

    <p>adjective, Mathematics</p>

    <p>Definition: able to be counted by one-to-one correspondence with the set of all positive integers.</p>

    <p>
    This is what I like to do when I am really having trouble understanding a concept. I go to the dictionary definition, and try to see if I can decipher anything from it. In this case, it's still fuzzy. It looks like enumerable is a way to describe if something can count or be counted indexed with a set of positive integers. </p>

    <p>This makes sense if you think of enumerators as a way to loop or iterate over a set of numbers. We can just think of enumerators now as a set of methods to do stuff. There is a whole bunch more happening behind the scenes, like issues with inheritance, code sharing, and mix-ins, but let's leave that for another time.</p>

    <p> So these methods we are talking about are "traversal and searching" methods, which have the ability to sort. By being built-in with the .each method, enumerators can yield successive members of a collection. Basically, these enumerators allow you to search, move, and otherwise manipulate data in a set. </p>

    <p> Once specific method that is an enumerator is the .map method. This method allows you to iterate over the object you specify, and apply a block of code to every element of that object. The output is a new array with the results of running the block once of each element of the object. For example, if you have an array of [1, 2, 3] and you run array.map {|n| n + 1}, this will pass each element of the array through the code block, add 1 to the number and then put the results in a new array.</p>

    <p>I'm still figuring out how to best use this method and in what situations, but it has proved to be pretty convenient up to this point.</p>
