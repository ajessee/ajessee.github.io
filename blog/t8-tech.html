    <p>Ruby on Rails. It sounds like some kind of programming on steroids. Or a toy train on a track. I don't really know what it is at this point, so let's learn together, shall we?
    </p>

    <p>From what I've read during my research, it seems like Ruby on Rails is a gem, or library for Ruby. In a sense, it is a toolbox for building web applications. It provides classes for saving to the database (I'm assuming this is SQL here) and handles URLs and displays HTML. The two main selling points that Rails itself uses are "Convention over Configuration" and "Don't Repeat Yourself." The convention over configuration principle means that the Rails library has built-in conventions so that you don't have to write lots of configurations. The example that I read about this is if you have a class called "Person" in your model, Rails automatically defaults to a table name "people" in the database. This prevents you from having to write all kinds of configuration code. The don't repeat yourself idea is something that is a pretty standard idea in coding.
    </p>

    <p>Ruby on Rails is built on a model-view-controller pattern. This basically means that Rails separates the data, logic, and display layers of your application. The data layer is based on a model, which is a name for a class that talks to the database. This prevents you from having to write SQL. Controllers take user input and decide what to do with that input. In an ideal situation where you have very efficient and well-written code, the controllers take the input, call the model methods with that input, and pass the output to the view. Finally, view displays the output, usually in HTML.</p>

    <p>I'm looking forward to diving in and learning Ruby on Rails. I will update this blog post once I have worked with it and truly understand it. Thanks for reading! </p>
