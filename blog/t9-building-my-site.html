    <p>The whole reason I decided to attend Dev Bootcamp is because I wanted to learn how to build things. I really like the concept of being an engineer and learning a craft. Early on, I was interested in web development. I remember when the internet first came out and I learned some basic HTML and put together a simple website. I went to school for other things and started working, but I would try to tinker with things every once in a while. The problem I found was that I didn't put in the time to learn the underlying technology. I would dabble for a bit, but when I tried to pick things back up after a year or so, the technology had changed.
    </p>

    <p>Now that I am enrolled in DBC and finishing the preparatory part of the program, I can look at my website with a small sense of pride. It's not very dynamic and it just uses HTML and CSS, but I really enjoyed the design aspect of putting it together. I spent a lot of time in the first couple weeks going down some rabbit holes trying to put it together. I decided that I wanted to do a full-screen "hero" image on most of the pages and have a black/white/grey theme. I did this mostly so that my website would look sleek, simple, and modern, even though it is really rudimentary. I can't wait to be equipped with the skills in Javascript and other web development languages and frameworks to really make my website dynamic and more interactive.

    <p>I struggled with getting my website to render correctly on different devices. I want to eventually put together a separate mobile site that will automatically pickup what kind of mobile device the user is on and then render it best based on that information. I'd like to add a card design element to the site for my resume and projects. I've tried to do it with my resume, but it's all CSS styling instead of Javascript.</p>

    <p>I know that this site is my web development portfolio, so I want to make it as beautiful and functional as I can. Stay tuned for more information about my progress.</p>
