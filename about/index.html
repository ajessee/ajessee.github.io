		<p>Hello world. My name is André. I am currently enrolled in Dev Bootcamp's Firefly cohort, and am learning about all things internet.</p>

		<p>I like to build things, which is why I chose to come to DBC. My goal is to build beautiful and useful web applications that help catalyze a shift towards the sharing economy. I believe that we have to reduce our ecological footprint on this planet in order to deal with the myriad of environmental problems we are facing, including the foremost threat of climate change. In my past life I was a project manager for a small international development firm that worked with USAID and the U.S. Department of State doing monitoring and evaluation for climate change projects.</p>

		<p>I just moved to Brooklyn from Washington D.C. and am enjoying exploring my new city and borough. I like to play basketball, ride my bike, climb things, and garden. You can reach me through any of my social links. Feel free to drop a line and say hello!</p>

		<p>P.S. I'm looking for a job starting in October 2015 in web development so if you are into hiring talented world-class beginners, let's talk!</p>

		<p>P.P.S. I ended up getting away from this guy.</p>
