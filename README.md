# My GitHub Pages Site 

The business card of portfolio websites!

Simple static GitHub page with landing page featuring a picture I took of Grand Central Station in New York City. Has mobile-friendly design using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

Has links to my [Big Dumb Web Dev](https://www.bigdumbweb.dev) portfolio site, my [creddle.io resume](https://resume.creddle.io/resume/bkvlgd5k80h), and a short 'About Me' page.
